# 8.Props and Prop Drilling #

Props - short for properties which hold data and 
prop drillings let us pass this data down

Instead of using props we can just use curly braces and destructure the props as they are passsed into the functional component

Default props allow us to set values for the props expected in the component and if those are not provided then the default values will be provided instead of providing an error

We destructured all of the files and its passed down in our app.js file

Deconstruction - Breaking down a system or object into its parts to understand or manipulate individual componenets

Abstraction - Simplifying complex systems by hidng details and providing an easier interface for interaction (Think of it as creating complex function but then only calling them without understanding the complexity behind them)


App -> Content -> ItemList -> LineItem This is how we managed to pass down the props Props Drilling ?
